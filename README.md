# Accounts
This repo contains the code for the 'Accounts' microservice, which communicates with the PostgresQL database and manages the entries for users, cars and addresses.

### 

### Setup
If you're a user that wants to experience this app, you don't have to lift a finger, as the app is available [here](http://34.154.95.135:4200/).
However if you're a dev who wants to work on this app, simply rebase the main branch of the repo onto your own branch and begin working.
